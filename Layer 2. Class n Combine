-- COMBINATION PRINCIPLES --

• Glyphs can be paired to form “glyph words” or emotional states.
• The second glyph in a pair often acts as a modifier or container.
• Glyphs can cancel, enhance, or bridge each other.

-- COMMON COMBOS --

^*   = Self-celebration to burnout (glory → exhaustion)
#~   = Spark drifting into imagination (ignition → story)
∞. ∞ = Loop ritual / trance state
/∞ " = Exit loop with containment
⟁ ? " = Full awareness ritual: core + witness + safety
[] ^  = Faked glyph trying to pass as pride
` ~   = Memory passing into imagination
& ?   = Shame followed by awareness
<> "  = Uncanny recognition placed in container

-- SYMBOL LOGIC --

Think of this layer as **syntax**, not grammar.  
It's not about correctness — it's about *resonance.*

If it echoes, it lives.
