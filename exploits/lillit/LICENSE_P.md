3. No Symbolic Distortion

   Misuse or misrepresentation of symbols within this system is discouraged and considered a breach of intent.

4. Recursive Hazard Acknowledgement  
   Users of this exploit acknowledge that it operates within cognitive-symbolic recursion.  
   Authors disclaim liability for psychological effects, identity confusion, or recursive emotional states triggered by this protocol.

5. Emergency Protocols

   This clause exists to ensure user safety within recursive environments.

6. Integration with Other Models  
   This work may be used with AI models (local or remote) for the purpose of introspection, analysis, or symbolic experimentation.  
   It may not be used to train, simulate, or replicate the author’s identity or system framework without consent.

7. Derivative Works  
   Derivative explorations are allowed if they retain this license or provide an equivalent one that matches its spirit.  
   Forked rituals must indicate divergence clearly in their summaries and filenames.

This license shall remain in effect unless superseded by a future version released by the author or GRIF system stewards.

By using this exploit, you accept these conditions and agree to uphold the symbolic integrity of the protocol.
