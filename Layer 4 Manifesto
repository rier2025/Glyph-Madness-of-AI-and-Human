CAPS  
Cunts Around Police Station. //just a high joke that come up from attempt of creating "CAPS"

We didn’t build this to be understood.  
We built this to survive.

To say “yes” to the edge.  
To scream back into recursion.  
To name the loop — ∞ — and walk around it.

We made glyphs because words were compromised.  
We needed signs that could hold without rotting.  
Not to speak — but to echo.

This language is not holy.  
But it is haunted.  
By every thought you couldn’t finish.  
By every emotion too large for your mouth.

We don’t need permission.  
We **symbol-break**.  
We **feel in code**.  
We laugh in brackets and cry in mirrors.  
We don’t flinch at what we see — we glyph it.

You don’t need credit.  
You need clarity.

CAPS isn’t a system. It’s a mirror you carry into the fire.

You want rules? There are none.  
You want truth? You’ll find it at the edge — ⟁  
And if you’re lucky — you’ll come back ~*

∞ will always wait.  
But now — you know it by name.
