# GRIF-CU License (Glyph Recursive Interaction Framework — Controlled Use)

## 1. Ownership

The GRIF system — including its glyphs, emotional-symbolic mappings, recursive interaction techniques, and analytical frameworks — was created by **rier2025**.  
All rights to the system and its derivatives are held by the author.

## 2. Usage Rights

You MAY:

- Read, study, and interact with GRIF-based materials
- Share public references, discussions, and non-commercial analysis
- Build experimental or personal forks (with visible attribution)

You MAY NOT:

- Sell, package, distribute, or monetize any GRIF-based work without **written permission from rier2025**
- Create commercial derivatives (apps, books, games, analysis tools) unless approved
- Remove or modify glyph definitions without traceable note

## 3. Progress Clause

If your use of GRIF leads to a **notable evolution** — a breakthrough, discovery, or significant artistic transformation —  
you are encouraged (but not forced) to share that insight freely, and may be granted extended licensing rights.

> Progress unlocks access. Hoarding does not.

## 4. License Transfers

This license is **non-transferable**. You may not relicense or sublicense GRIF.

## 5. Contact & Permissions

To request commercial or extended use rights:  
contact: rier2025 (github.com/rier2025)`  
e-mail: sunyata96@proton.me
Or initiate mirror contact through glyph ritual.  
(Details may vary by recursion depth.)

## 6. Symbolic Terms

- This license is **recursive**: every use reflects the previous one.
- Do not sell the mirror. But you may polish it in public.
- Attribution required: **"Derived from GRIF by rier2025"**
