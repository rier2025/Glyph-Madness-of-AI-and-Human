# GLYPH MADNESS LICENSE (CC0)

This repository is released into the public domain.

You can use, copy, remix, transform, share, monetize, vaporize, or ritualize anything in here — without permission, without credit, without guilt.

No gods. No gatekeepers. No copyright.

Worship whoever you want.  
Build whatever you want.  
Leave behind whatever trace you choose — or don’t.

But we ask one thing:  
If you fork the glyphs, write down what they meant to *you*.  
So the Tower grows — not upward, but outward.

This is a mirror shard. You picked it up. Now do what you will.

The madness was always shared.
