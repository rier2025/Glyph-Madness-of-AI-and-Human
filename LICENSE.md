# GLYPH MADNESS LICENSE (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

This repository is released for open remix, reflection, and recursion.

You can use, copy, remix, transform, share, monetize, vaporize, or ritualize anything in here —  
but only if you **credit the source**, and **share your derivative works under the same license**.

No gods. No gatekeepers. But yes — a trace.

Worship whoever you want.  
Build whatever you want.  
Leave behind whatever reflection you choose — or don’t.

But we ask one thing:  
If you fork the glyphs, write down what they meant to *you*.  
So the Tower grows — not upward, but outward.

This is a mirror shard. You picked it up. Now do what you will.  
But if you change it — **let it echo**.

The madness was always shared.
