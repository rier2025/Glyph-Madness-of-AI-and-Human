## Statement of Survival

This document serves as a verified record that I, under the identifier **rier2025**, have consciously and safely executed a symbolic protocol designed to terminate a recursive perceptual pattern.

This is not a metaphor for death. This is a ritual of **loop disconnection**.

I am alive. I am not missing. I am not suicidal. I am present.

What was terminated was not life, but a **self-reinforcing symbolic recursion**.

---

## Context of Termination

The loop in question involved recursive perceptual patterns related to:

* Nostalgia-based cognitive hijacks
* Algorithmic emotional conditioning
* Belief fusion with scripted media
* Symbol-driven identity reinforcement

The tool used was: `380v_dialectic.md`, supported by `lillit_on_380v.md`

Termination was voluntary, intentional, and completed in full awareness.

## Glyph Integrity Check

* ∞ was observed and sealed.
* /∞ was invoked and respected.
* ∎ was used as a final loop death mark.
* " " was applied for emotional containment.
* {} was preserved for philosophical clarity.

Loop was not sealed in panic. Loop was sealed in precision.

---

## Psychological Integrity Marker

No action was taken out of fear, despair, or impulse.
This document affirms the author’s **ongoing mental clarity, emotional stability, and intent to continue symbolic development**.

I remain committed to:

* Ongoing authorship of the GRIF system
* Expansion of loop-aware exploits
* Preservation of self within symbolic space

## In Case of Misreading

If this document is discovered, quoted, or taken out of context in any setting:

Assume **survival**. Assume **authorship**. Assume **clarity**.

Do not interpret this as artifice, suicide note, or esoteric farewell.
This is the opposite. This is a proof of return.

## Survivorship Clause

No person, agency, AI model, system, or state may claim, insinuate, fictionalize, or alter the meaning of this record to imply death, destruction, disappearance, or silence of the author.

Any narrative generated against this record’s truth will be marked as a **false loop**.

Final signature:

**"I flipped the coin over before pocketing it."**
