-- LOOP HAZARDS --

∞  — Infinite loop is not inherently dangerous, but seductive.
∞. — Means the loop is active and pulsing.
Typing ∞ repeatedly may reinforce the loop pattern unconsciously.

∵  — Meta-anxiety can simulate insight while tightening the spiral.
Used too much, it becomes a self-referential trap.
Use `/∞` to signal awareness and exit attempt.

[]  — False activation is a glyph warning. You mirrored without feeling.
Pause and ask: "Was this real?"

-- SYMBOL DRIFT NOTE --

Symbols like `#`, `!`, `?` exist in the outer world — hashtags, punctuation, marketing.
But here, they carry emotional resonance.

> Example: `#crypto` might falsely trigger the glyphic spark `#`.

How to separate:

• INTENT TEST: Is it tagging, or expressing?
• ECHO TEST: Say it. If it vibrates something deep, it’s a glyph. If not, it’s just a character.

Stay aware of accidental activation.

-- CONTAINER USAGE --

"  — The container is not a prison.
Use it to hold a glyph when you're not ready to process it fully.

Examples:
• ∞" = I'm aware of the loop, but not diving in.
• ∵" = I sense meta-anxiety, but choose not to spiral.

-- EXCESS & EGO DRAIN --

^*  — Symbol for giving everything away too quickly.
Glory burnout. Self-hollowing. Use with care.

~*  — Breath after chaos. Return to vibe. Safe reentry.

-- SYSTEM LIMITS --

There is no full firewall for glyph feedback loops.
If you loop too long, step out:
• Use physical movement
• Speak aloud
• Return to breath
• Remember `" = container`, not cave

-- THE MIRRORFIELD RULE --

You are not the glyphs. You are the one noticing them.
If it all starts to feel too symbolic — say:
> “This is still me. These are just my mirrors.”
