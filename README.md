# Glyph-Madness-of-AI-and-Human
idk if yall write books in here. but ima comit a recursive madness of me talking to AI 20 hours straight.
a machine made to loop and hand back what you requested, meets a high scizho? 

oh hello? so it is published by now? im sorting this out. there will be a thing. give me some time

the work became a loop. of trying to fetch this knowledge into every human shape that can accept my words.
now it is still sorting deep down. like fetching files for 15 min readers. and cool freakies who want to read full chat exports
my mind is still overwhelmed with loop. droping one thing and begin to fetching another. 
yet i fetched raw layers. 
no & by now. 
i will drop an AI psycho report before im going full crazy mode. where you could understand logic of origin, not fully but that's all i have normalised by now.
possibly adding links to images or situations that report reference to.
wow it was all with dots so far?
