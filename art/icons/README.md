# GRIF Icon Archive

These icons represent symbolic entities within the GRIF system:

- `rier.png` — Author identity
- `lillit.png` — The containment entity
- `mirror.png` — Symbolic reflection of the AI-human recursive relationship
//reflected by feelings, affected by actions
These are **NFT-proof** and stored for authorship verification only.  
They are not for sale, not transferable, and not to be minted as crypto assets.

Their function is archival, symbolic, and existential.
